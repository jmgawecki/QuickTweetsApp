# QuickTweetsApp

Quick Tweets App is my second project. The app allows users to search for users from Twitter. Users can read tweets from the app, add users to their favorite user's bucket, and add specific tweets to their favorite tweet's bucket. The app allows users to see a tweet in its full version through Safari.
Technology used:
- UIKit
- User Defaults as Persistence Manager
- Network Calls
- CocoaPods integration
- 3rd party library integration (Swifter)
- Twitter APIs
- Safari Web Services
- Collection Views 
- Diffable Data Source
- Compositional Layouts
- UI adjustment to screen sizes (including iPhone SE 1st gen. and iPhone 8 Zoomed)
The project stores some sensitive data, therefore source code can be shared upon request:)
- Night/Light mode UI adjustment
